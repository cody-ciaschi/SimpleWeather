# Simple Weather
This is a simple weather app using the AccuWeather Apis and React.

## Usage
To use:
- Go to accuweather.com and sign up for a free account. Create a new project so that you can obtain an apikey.
- Clone the repo.
- Navigate to App.js and place your API between the quotes next to `APIKEY=` at the top of the file.
- Ensure you have Node.js version 14 or greater.
- Run `http-server -c-1` in your terminal.
- Have Fun!

## Future Improvements
For this simple project I really focused on learning the ins and outs of grabbing data from APIs and creating a dynamic webpage from it. In the future I would like to update the look of it with Material-ui or Bootstrap. I would also like to add a way to look at multiple places at the same time.
